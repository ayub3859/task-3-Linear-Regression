# Task 3: Linear Regression - House Price Prediction

## Objective
The goal is to implement both Simple and Multiple Linear Regression models to predict house prices based on multiple features.

## Dataset
Used: `Housing.csv`  
Contains features such as area, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, location amenities, etc.

## Steps Performed
- Loaded and preprocessed the dataset
- Converted categorical variables using encoding
- Handled missing values
- Split data into training and testing sets
- Built a linear regression model using `scikit-learn`
- Evaluated the model using MAE, MSE, R² score
- Visualized regression results

## Libraries Used
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

## Results
Achieved reasonable R² and low MSE on the test data. Visualizations helped understand trends and correlations.
